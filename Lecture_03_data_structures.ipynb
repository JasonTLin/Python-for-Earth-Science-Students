Another way to generate a list is to use **range( )**, which is one of the python  _built-in functions_ we mentioned in Lecture 2.  **range( )** is a _list generator_ and can be used to generate a list of integers between two numbers, , the _start_ and _end_, where each number is separated by a specified interval. Here Python 3 is a bit different from earlier versions of python in that older versions (Python 2.7) generated the list directly, but new to Python 3.0, you have to make the list from the generator like so:  has the form: **list(range(start,end,interval))**.
