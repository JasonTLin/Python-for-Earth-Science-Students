    "     -  Create an empty list called **oceans**\n",

    "     -  print the last ocean \n",
    "     -  make a shallow copy of **oceans** called **seas** and a deep copy of **oceans** called  **big_water**. Try to modify the copies. Verify that the shallow copy refers to the same underlying object while the deep copy makes an independent object.  \n",

    "     -  Create a tuple called **continents** with the continents as elements.\n",
